# Changelog

This is the changelog for this fork of OMI.
It documents the changes in each of the tagged releases

## 2.2.1 - 2021-07-14

+ Fixed up logic used to determine what library to use on unknown Linux distributions
  + https://github.com/jborean93/omi/issues/30
  + https://github.com/jborean93/omi/issues/31

## 2.2.0 - 2021-04-07

+ Created universal builds to be used across the various nix distributions
  + `glibc` is based on CentOS 7 and is designed for most GNU/Linux distributions, EL/Debian/Arch/etc
  + `musl` is based on Alpine 3 and is designed for busybox/Linux distributions, Alpine
  + `macOS` is based on macOS
  + These universal builds is designed to reduce the number of `libmi` builds being distributed and automatically support future distribution releases as they are made
+ Deprecated the `-Distribution` parameter of `Install-WSMan` as it no longer does anything
+ Removed support for Debian 8 and Fedora 31 due to the age of the distribution
+ Added initial support for OpenSSL 3.x for glibc, musl, and macOS based distributions
+ Added support for using OpenSSL installed from `port` if `brew` is not used on macOS
  + One of them must be installed but you are no longer limited to just `brew`
+ Use `@loader_path` on macOS instead of `@executable_path` for loading `libmi` to support relative paths from the library itself rather than `pwsh`
+ `Register-TrustedCertificate` will now create a file with a determinable name to avoid creating duplicate entries

## 2.1.0 - 2020-11-24

+ Added the following distributions
  + `fedora33`
  + `ubuntu20.04`
+ Make a backup of the original library files in the PowerShell dir before installing the forked copies
+ Merge in upstream changes to stay in sync
  + Upstream changes were based on server side configuration updates and logging and not something that affects PowerShell's WSMan client code

## 2.0.0 - 2020-10-17

### Breaking Changes

+ GitHub release artifacts are now a `.tar.gz` for each distribution containing `libmi` and `libpsrp`
+ Removed the script `tools/Get-OmiVersion.ps1` in favour of `Get-WSManVersion` that is included in the new `PSWSMan` module

### Changes

+ Created `PSWSMan` which is a PowerShell module uploaded to the PowerShell Gallery that can install and manage the OMI libraries for you
+ Build `libpsrpclient` as well and add it to the release artifacts
+ Added Alpine 3 to the build matrix
+ Added support for reading `New-PSSessionOption -SkipCACheck -SkipCNCheck` from PowerShell instead of relying on the env vars
  + Requires PowerShell v7.2.0
  + v7.2.0 and later do not need to have `-SessionOption (New-PSSessionOption -SkipCACheck -SkipCNCheck)` set
  + Those options can now also control cert verification behaviour per session
  + Older versions must still set those session options and use the env vars to skip cert verification

## 1.2.1 - 2020-09-26

+ Fix build for macOS to link against OpenSSL 1.1 and not 1.0.2

## 1.2.0 - 2020-09-25

+ Added support for channel binding tokens to work with `Auth/CbtHardeningLevel = Strict`
+ Improved error messages displayed when dealing with OpenSSL errors
+ Turned on HTTPS certificate validation by default ignoring whatever is set from PowerShell
  + You still need to specify `-SessionOption (New-PSSessionOption -SkipCACheck -SkipCNCheck)` when creating the session in PowerShell
  + These session options are ignored in this OMI library, to disable cert verification here, set the env vars `OMI_SKIP_CA_CHECK=1` and `OMI_SKIP_CN_CHECK=1`
  + A future version may respect the `-SessionOption` skip checks in the future but until that data is actually sent to the library we opt for a safer default by always checking unless our env vars are set

## 1.1.0 - 2020-09-01

+ Added Archlinux as a known distribution

## 1.0.1 - 2020-08-20

+ Increased password length limit to allow connecting with JWT tokens to Exchange Online that routinely exceed 1KiB in size.
+ Take back point about NTLM working on macOS, while it can work when you use HTTPS, it will fail with the message encryption due to a flaw in macOS NTLM through SPNEGO mechanism

## 1.0.0 - 2020-08-19

Initial release.
